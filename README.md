= Simple questionnaire application

This application is used by my wife in her disert theme. First incarnation is
on http://github.com/pepe/questionnaire. This is redone with
(Padrino)[http://www.padrinorb.com/]. Second concern for me is to use BDD on
some real world example. Keep in mind that application is simplistics and one
issue solving. But still could be used as example of BDD and NOSQL.

Instruction on deploying and running comming soon.
